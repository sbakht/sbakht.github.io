description: a game where you feel like coding

I recently started playing the game [Spacechem][steam]. I've had it for years in my steam inventory and I've tried it for 5 minutes a while back, but the tutorial told me nothing so I shut it off.

Then I came across this video:

He explained it pretty well so I decided to give the game another shot and WOW is it just like programming! The way I was sitting there trying to figure out how to solve the game puzzles is the same way I work through programming puzzles. 

It's very logic based which is what I think creates the similarites. When you complete a puzzle, it shows you how long it took for your "program" to execute and how many pieces you used and it compares your score to your friends scores. In this way it makes you want to go back and optimize your solution just like when writing an algorithm

There isn't much else to say except its really a game worth checking out, especially for all the coders out there.
