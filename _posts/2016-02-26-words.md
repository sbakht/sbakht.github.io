I'm currently going through a [course on emotional intelligence](https://www.openlearning.com/courses/Success) and I learned something pretty interesting about the words we give things. Take this picture:

What did you think when you saw this cockroach? Probably something like "2spooky4me" or "KILL IT WITH FIRE". Now that isn't a very positive viewpoint is it? What if we had a more neutral or positive viewpoint when encountering an image of a cockroach? 

Instead you might be impressed by how something so small could be so powerful for its size. Or maybe how it can scare humans so easily. Or maybe you become curious on how tehse things have survived for so long? 

> Cockroaches' ability to withstand extreme radiation exposure may come down to their simple bodies and slower cell cycles. Cells are said to be most sensitive to radiation when they're dividing. That's why humans are more vulnerable â€” they have some cells that are constantly splitting up.

Now there is something we wouldn't know if we just avoided cockroaches forever. Also by being curious about them instead of scared, there was a tech idea to use cameras on them for various purposes. 

The whole idea here is that the thoughts and words you abscribe to anything can completely change the result. Sometimes altering your viewpoint is a good idea to be more creative or just have a more positive outlook on life.
