description: what is a game in vr?
---

I think virtual reality kind of blurs the line between what we consider a game or not. When I look at "experiences" like Tiltbrush, I'm not sure if I consider that a game or not. I think I'd consider it a game because it sure feels bun to be n a 3d area where you can draw anything, but then again it really is just a VR Microsoft Paint. I can see alot of people enjoying it and similar experiences yet they wouldn't really call themselves gamers.

This could just be a situation like with mobile games. There are tons of people that play mobile games but no one considers them gamers. They don't consider themselves as people that play games nor do others ascribe it to them. I think virtual reality could blur the line between what is considered gaming. It is instead possible a random line will be drawn like with smartphones, but in the end it doesn't really matter. It's just a label, but labels do have consequences.
